### Like identifying birds by ear? Looking for an excuse to rewatch Game of Thrones before the final season comes out in 2019?

Help ID the birds singing and chirping away in the background of the
show! I've loved noticing Prairie Warblers in the Red Waste and the
Dothraki Sea, loons wailing at Riverrun, Northern Cardinals chirping
cheerily away in Dorne, and much more. However, there are a lot of bird
sounds on this show, and it turns out I just don't know that many birds.
I could use your help!

### About This App:

Look at observations across the Game of Thrones world using the
**Observation Map**, or view them in table form at the **Observation
Table**. And of course, **Submit Observations** of your own! There isn't
a lot of data yet, so the map is simple. If I manage to get a lot of
identifications, I'll get fancier with the exploratory capacity offered
by the map.

I wouldn't have been able to build the app without:

    example](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/063-superzip-example)
