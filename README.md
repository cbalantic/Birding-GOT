Birding Game of Thrones (by ear)

For funsies and to teach myself new things, I'm making an app that will map out bird vocalizations used in Game of Thrones (the show). When it's live, I'm hoping to invite fellow GOT + birding-by-ear enthusiasts to contribute their observations. Kind of a knock-off version of Cornell's eBird, Westeros-style. :)
