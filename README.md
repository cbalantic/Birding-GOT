Birding Game of Thrones (by ear)

ETA in 2020: This app is no longer maintained! Some things changed with one of the package dependencies, and after how bad season 8 was I will not bother maintaining this app out of disappointed spite. 

To teach myself new things, I made a simple app to map out bird vocalizations used in Game of Thrones (the show), available here: https://cbalantic.shinyapps.io/birding-got/

I invite fellow GOT & birding-by-ear enthusiasts to contribute their observations via the **Submit Observations** tab of the app. It's a knock-off version of Cornell's eBird, Westeros-style.

The app is hosted for free on shinyapps.io, so if you can't access it, this means I've run out of my free server time for the month.
