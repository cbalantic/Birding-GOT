Birding Game of Thrones (by ear)

To teach myself new things, I made a simple app to map out bird vocalizations used in Game of Thrones (the show). I invite fellow GOT + birding-by-ear enthusiasts to contribute their observations via the the Submit Observation tab of the app. Kind of a knock-off version of Cornell's eBird, Westeros-style. :)
