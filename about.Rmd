## About this app

I like Game of Thrones.

I like listening to birds.

I like noticing the (real) bird sounds included in the background of the show. Prairie Warblers in the Red Waste and the Dothraki Sea! Loons at Riverrun! Northern Cardinals chirping cheerily away in Dorne! Ravens (or are they crows?) and gull sounds everywhere! And all kinds of mystery birds that I don't know. [Link to a tab with Mystery Bird sounds that would prompt others to identify them?] Maybe if we get enough observations and data, we can have a fun little distribution map to look at. 

YAY.
