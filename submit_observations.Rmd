### Tips for submitting observations:
Only submit an observation for a species and location once per episode! If you already observed a Prairie Warbler in the Dothraki Sea in S2E7, you don't need to log it again every time it sings.

**Your Name**: Your real name is not required. Just input some kind of identifier for yourself.  

**Species you observed (common name)**: Put down the common name of the species you observed. Since common names can differ geographically, you also have the option to input the **latin name** in the next field. 

**Location**: Choose a location to the best of your knowledge. If a location is available on the map, but not in the dropdown menu, that's because I think the location is never actually visited in the show. If I've made a mistake, just select "Unknown" and explain yourself in the **Comments** field. Same with if you're not sure where a bird was observed -- select "Unknown", describe the scene in the comments, and leave the **season**, **episode number**, and approximate **time of episode**. I'll sort out a location based on that info.
