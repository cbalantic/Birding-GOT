## Tips for submitting observations

Explanation about how to submit birding by ear observations for Game of Thones. 

If a location is available on the map, but not available in the dropdown menu, that's probably because I'm at least 95% certain that location is never actually visited in the show (it's only in the book) and therefore we shouldn't have any bird observations there. If I've made a mistake here, just select "UNKNOWN" and explain yourself in the "notes". Same with if you're not sure where a bird was observed -- you can just select the "UNKNOWN" option, perhaps describe the scene in the notes (which characters? was it day or night?), and definitely leave the season, episode number, and approximate minute of the episode. 

Please submit an observation for an episode and location only once per episode! e.g., if you already observed a Northern Cardinal at Sunspear in S5E7, you don't need to submit it again every time you hear the bird singing, or if the episode bounces back and forth between Sunspear and other locations (though it's fine if someone else does).
